In any right triangle, the distance from the right angle (vertex B) to the midpoint M of the hypotenuse is equal to half the length of the hypotenuse AC. Mathematically:
𝐵𝑀 = (1/2)𝐴𝐶

import math
AB = int(input())
BC = int(input())
MBCradian = math.atan(AB/BC)
MBCdegree = math.degrees(MBCradian)
print(f"{MBCdegree:.0f}\u00b0")
